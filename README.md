# VitualNumericKeypad
An old-style celll phone's enhanced keypad simulation for PC </br>
It functions quite like an old Nokia keypad with some modifications:
* Instead of tapping multiple times on a button to provide a letter, you just have to press on a button and then drag your mouse into the right case.
* Because of the functionality above, this keypad nolonger uses T9 autocomplete feature, instead it uses a normal autocomplete, which is quite similar to thoses using on smartphone.
