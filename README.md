# VitualNumericKeypad
An old-style celll phone's enhanced keypad simulation for PC </br>
It functions quite like an old Nokia keypad with some modifications:
* Instead of tapping multiple times on a button to provide a letter, you just have to press on a button and then drag your mouse into the right case.
* Because of the functionality above, this keypad nolonger uses T9 autocomplete feature, instead it uses a normal autocomplete, which is quite similar to thoses using on smartphone.
A few updates:
* Right-click on the window (but not on the buttons) will perform an autocomplete.
* A long drag can still provide a letter, this improve the writing speed.
